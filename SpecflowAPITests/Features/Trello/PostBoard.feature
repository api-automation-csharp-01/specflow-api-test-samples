Feature: Create Board

@deleteTrelloBoard
Scenario: Board is created with name
	Given I use the "Trello" service client
	When I send a "Trello" POST request to "boards" with the following json body
		"""
		{ 
			"name": "Test automation CSharp",
			"desc": "This board has been created using SpecFlow",
			"idOrganization": "5f5801b5776a7a5da2f3561a",
			"prefs_permissionLevel": "public",
			"prefs_comments": "org",
			"prefs_invitations": "admins",
			"prefs_background": "green"			
		}
		"""
	And I store response id for workspace cleaning
	Then I validate that the response status code is "200"
	And I validate that the response body match "Schemas/Trello/PostBoardSchema.json" JSON schema
	And I validate that the response body contains the following values
